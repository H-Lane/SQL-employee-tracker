# SQL-employee-tracker

Week 12 Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a SQL databse with a command line interface in order to track employee data. This project was meant to provide me with experience utilizing postgres for SQL database management and the inquirer prompt to accept user input. Through the creation of this code I have become much more familiar with the SQL syntax and the various benefits a relational database can provide.
